# UCRM Client Signup
A [UCRM plugin](https://github.com/Ubiquiti-App/UCRM-plugins) that allows a customer to signup via a checkout format.

_Developed by [Charuwts, LLC](https://charuwts.com)_

When installed onto UCRM the plugin public URL will display a form that anyone can enter valid info into to create a client. The aim of the plugin is to simplify the process of transitioning a prospective customer to a client so development is ongoing to seek to improve upon this aim.
